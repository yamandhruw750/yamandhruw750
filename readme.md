# &#128640; Hey there, I'm Yaman! &#128075;

I'm a **beginner web developer** on a mission to turn ideas into interactive experiences.

Currently exploring the world of **HTML, CSS, Javascript** and build my way up to **React** and **Node.js** &#128187;

## &#128161; What I'm up to:

- &#127793; Learning full-stack development one project at a time.
- &#129504; Experimenting with front-end design and clean UI.
- ⚙️ Working on small projects to sharpen my skills.
- 📚 Diving into Git, Github, and version control like a pro-in-training.
